Node.js implementation of cross-platform *Todo By Me* application written in TypeScript, implementing Firebase SDK for managing authentication, database and data storage.

Because this project ignores compiled TypeScript, you need to perform compilation yourself. I have put together a concise
`tsconfig.json` file as well as building rules in `package.json`, simplifying compilation to

    ~$ npm start
    
I am using Jest for tests, you can run them with

    ~$ npm test

This project is being developed on Node.js version `10.15.3`.
