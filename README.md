# Todo By Me

Server-side implementation of cross-platform *Todo By Me* application. Backend is written in TypeScript running on Node.js,
and implements Firebase SDK for managing authentication, database and data storage.

Because this project ignores compiled TypeScript, you need to compile it yourself. I have put together a pretty restrictive
`tsconfig.json` file as well as building rules in `package.json`.
